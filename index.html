        <h1>What is Scratch?</h1>
        <p>Scratch is a visual programming language and the world's largest coding community for children, providing a simple interface for creating coding projects such as stories, games, and simulations. Scratch was developed by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2003 and was publicly released in 2007.<br><br> Scratch was designed to support and promote critical thinking and problem-solving skills, as well as collaboration with other people using Scratch. Scratch uses block-style coding, making it easy for beginners to learn and understand coding concepts. The platform also has its own paint editor and sound builder, allowing users to create their own unique projects.<br><br>
